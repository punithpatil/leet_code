# https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-numbers-disappeared-in-an-array/

# Given an array of integers where 1 â‰¤ a[i] â‰¤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.

# Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.

# Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.

# Example:

# Input:
# [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

# Output:
# [5,6]
